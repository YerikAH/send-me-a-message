# Send me a message ‚úâÔ∏è

A simple form, you will send a message to my email. Developed with PHP, PHPMailer, but the deployment is developed with HTML only using [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/). 

## Development üß±

The development of FormSubmit, for me was simple and easy. I just need my email and follow the FormSubmit instructions, however, I am learning PHP, so I also developed it with PHP, however I had some problems with my credentials. I really didn't want to make this repository private.

Anyway if you want to test the functionality of my application.

1. `git clone https://github.com/YerikAH/send-me-a-message.git`<br/>
1. `cd send-me-a-message/php`<br/>
1. `composer install`<br/>
1. In the `php/email.php` file enter your email and password.
1. Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP.
1. in your browser `localhost/send-me-a-message/php/index.php`.
1. Send me a message.
